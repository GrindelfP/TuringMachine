# Turing Machine project
## Description

This is an attempt to create an instance of a concept, proposed
by Alan Turing in 1936. The concept is a machine, which can
perform a set of actions on a tape, which is divided into cells.
Each cell can contain a symbol from a finite set of symbols, called an alphabet.
The machine can read the symbol from the cell, write a new symbol to the cell,
move the tape left or right, and change its state, as well as keep everything
as it is. The machine is controlled by a set of rules, which are called a program.
The machine results if and when it reaches a state, which is called a final state, which
means that it stops. If the provided program data is incorrect, or incomplete 
or impossible to execute, the machine will not stop.
